# uVNC Remote Control
Frontend for uVNC, like (Gen/Zen)Control created with PureBASIC (https://www.purebasic.com/)
 
 -NOTE-
 For AD Import functionality, you must obtain a copy of ADFind from JoeWare (http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)
 Place ADFind.exe and adcsv.pl in the same directory as uVNCRemoteControl.exe.
 When you run uVNCRemoteControl.exe a new button will appear in the "Program Options" tab for importing computers from AD.

Application:

  - Little tool to connect to a remote machine on a domain network
  - Typical use: Trying to assist a user remotely
  
  -----------------------
-Concept (normal mode)-
-----------------------

This is the normal behavior:

  1 check if there's a valid IP address assigned to the client 
  2 ping the client 
  3 map the client C$, create the RCTemp folder and copy VNC over 
  4 start the vnc server on the remote client 
  5 start vnc viewer on localhost and connect to client 
  6 after viewer exits, stop VNC service, delete files on client 
  7 unhide GUI on localhost

Example setup
-------------

Assume the following setup:

  - a user is at their desk at another location, connected to the network
  - this user is having an issue with an application
  - we try to assist remotely by using this tool

Notes
